# fn
Function approximation with Neural Networks! 

Using shallow neural networks to learn mathematical functions.
Trigonometric functions, rational functions, polynomials, etc etc
Even boolean functions! (build a small CPU with neural networks as the logical gates?)

## Goal
Construct a framework where a user can input a function, and a neural network is automatically created to learn the function.
The goal is ultimatley to use as few neurons and hidden layers as possible

# Theory
The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a neural network with a single hidden layer to approximate any continious function on a closed interval to arbitrary error
